# Vehicle Maintenance Platform

## Overview
This project is a **Predictive Vehicle Maintenance Platform** built with **React**, **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. The platform aims to leverage **AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **IoT** sensors to provide real-time diagnostics, predictive maintenance, and supply chain optimization for vehicle manufacturers and fleet operators.

The application collects vehicle health data from IoT sensors, predicts maintenance needs, and provides customized maintenance schedules to reduce downtime and costs.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Diagnostics**: Continuous monitoring of vehicle health metrics (e.g., engine, brake wear, tire condition).
- **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered forecasts of potential vehicle failures based on historical and real-time data.
- **Automated Supply Chain Optimization**: Streamlines parts procurement by predicting demand.
- **Personalized Maintenance Plans**: Generates maintenance schedules based on driving habits and environmental conditions.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - React
  - CSS (for styling)
- **Backend**: 
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB
- **AI/ML**: Python (TensorFlow or PyTorch) for predictive modeling (optional for advanced implementation)
- **Deployment**: 
  - Heroku (for backend)
  - Netlify (for frontend)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js**: [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Set up a MongoDB account at [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a database cluster.
- **React**: The project is built with React, so ensure that Node.js is installed to run React applications.

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

#### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder>
    ```

2. Install the backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your MongoDB URI:
    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-atlas-uri
    ```

4. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

   The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Frontend Setup

1. In a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

   The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Connecting the Frontend and Backend

- Ensure that the frontend can communicate with the backend by adding a proxy to `frontend/package.json`:
    ```json
    "proxy": "http://localhost:5000"
    ```

   This will forward API requests from the frontend to the backend.

### MongoDB Setup

1. Set up a **MongoDB Atlas** account and create a database cluster.
2. Create a database and collection for storing vehicle data, maintenance records, and other information.
3. Update the `MONGO_URI` in your `.env` file with the connection string provided by MongoDB Atlas.

## Usage

- **Dashboard**: Displays real-time vehicle status, maintenance alerts, and key metrics.
- **Maintenance Schedule**: Shows upcoming maintenance tasks and historical maintenance data.
- **Analytics**: Provides insights into predictive maintenance needs and parts procurement optimization.

## Future Enhancements

- **AI/ML Models**: Integrate machine learning models for predictive maintenance using historical data.
- **User Roles**: Add role-based authentication for fleet managers, maintenance personnel, and administrators.
- **Mobile App**: Create a mobile app for fleet operators to track vehicle health on the go.
